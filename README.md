## MP2- ARP Protocole Simulation in Python and Packet Tracer
### Instruction on running the code:
- Run `arp_client.py` and `arp_server.py` files in different terminals.
- Provide an IP address in as input in the terminal of `arp_client.py`.
- If the IP address exits in the "NETWORK" dictionary of `arp_server.py`, it will return the corresponding MAC address. If it doesn't exit, it return "Not Found".

Note: The packet tracer file that was used for this project can be found as `ARP_simulator.ptk`.
